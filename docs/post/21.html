### Background

I really enjoy playing a game, which handles almost everything on client side, and its server side is for ranking, replays, online matches, etc. As always, the server has a bad network connection for players in mainland China like me. So I was thinking if I could setup a relay server on my VPS, to provide a better connection of the game.

### 1. Setup the relay server

What I was thinking is a topology as follows:

```
+----------+     https     +----------+     https     +----------+
|          ---------------->          ---------------->          |
|          |               |          |               |  Actual  |
|  Client  |               |   Relay  |               |  server  |
|          |               |          |               |          |
|          <----------------          <----------------          |
+----------+     https     +----------+     https     +----------+
```

Actually it was going quite well. I use Traefik in the frontend to route all related requests to the backend. And in the backend there is a nginx instance to do a just `proxy_pass` job.

One thing I'd like to mention is how nginx is dealing with SSL/TLS certification. Requests it received from the frontend is http w/o TLS. I had to add the marked lines to make it work with actual server side TLS certification:

```nginx
server {
  listen 8080;
  server_name localhost;      # <--
  location / {
    resolver 8.8.8.8;
    proxy_pass https://actual.server.com$request_uri;
    proxy_ssl_server_name on; # <--
    proxy_ssl_session_reuse on;
  }
}
```

Let's take a closer look of the topology now:

```
                           +----------------------------------------------+
                           |                 Relay server                 |
                           |                                              |
+----------+     https     |   +---------+       http       +---------+   |     https     +----------+
|          -------------------->         ------------------->         -------------------->          |
|          |               |   |         |                  |         |   |               |  Actual  |
|  Client  |               |   | Traefik |                  |  nginx  |   |               |  server  |
|          |               |   |         |                  |         |   |               |          |
|          <--------------------         <-------------------         <--------------------          |
+----------+     https     |   +---------+       http       +---------+   |     https     +----------+
                           |                                              |
                           +----------------------------------------------+
```

So it works... Does it? Yeah technically it works very well, for doing the relay job. But here's an issue that about half of the time I can't hold a stable network connection between my client and the relay server! MANY THANKS TO THE FIREWALL. So it comes the bad news that the relay server doesn't do any help of a better connection.

But I would not stop here. Quickly I realized the whole traffic between the client and the server was going through my relay server, which meant that I could monitor anything in it, or even manipulate it as I want.

Let's insert a middleware within the relay server!

### 2. Insert the middleware

I'd like to get rid of all the SSL/TLS stuff. So the best place are there: between Traefik and nginx. I put a http proxy in Golang there (first time Golang experience!).

The http proxy instance is a modified version of [wtsi-hgi/http-proxy-logger](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/http-proxy-logger), with which I can dump the traffic I care to try to understand the packet structure. Now the topology looks like this:

```
                           +-------------------------------------------------------------+
                           |                         Relay server                        |
                           |                                                             |
+----------+     https     |  +---------+   http   +-------------+   http   +---------+  |     https     +----------+
|          ------------------->         -----------|-----(#)-----|---------->         ------------------->          |
|          |               |  |         |          |             |          |         |  |               |  Actual  |
|  Client  |               |  | Traefik |          |  Http Proxy |          |  nginx  |  |               |  server  |
|          |               |  |         |          |             |          |         |  |               |          |
|          <-------------------         <----------|-----(#)-----|-----------         <-------------------          |
+----------+     https     |  +---------+   http   +-------------+   http   +---------+  |     https     +----------+
                           |                                                             |
                           +-------------------------------------------------------------+

                                                         (#) - dump requests/responses
```

Everything is under my control. Can I do some funny things to the traffic?

### 3. Trick the client

Thanks to other excellent open-source private server implements, I can find out what messages are sent back to the client by directly reading their source code. It caught my attention that a very bit indicates the user is a supporter, which unlocks some more options on the client side (, and client side only!).

It took me a bit longer time to exactly understand how the bytes are transferred in the response body and extract them in Golang [(code)](https://github.com/purple4pur/goup). And finally I was very surprised that the whole flow worked! Here's the topology now:

```
                           +-------------------------------------------------------------+
                           |                         Relay server                        |
                           |                                                             |

|          |               |  |         |          |             |          |         |  |               |  Actual  |

                           +-------------------------------------------------------------+

                                                         (*) - trick here!
```

### What's next?

Well, when I found that special bit, I was asking more options that the client could give me. But the reality is it only gives me about 50% of my expectation. It's not a actual issue because I was giving a best guess of it.

So I'm planing some further steps from here, including bringing back a monitor-only mode, finding more interesting bytes in the traffic, and one more step: can I do some server side jobs? Now I'm so curious if it's possible to implement the friend ranking in the relay side.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I really enjoy playing a game, which handles almost everything on client side, and its server side is for ranking, replays, online matches, etc. As always, the server has a bad network connection for players in mainland China like me. So I was thinking if I could setup a relay server on my VPS, to provide a better connection of the game.</p>
<h3>1. Setup the relay server</h3>
<p>What I was thinking is a topology as follows:</p>
<pre class="notranslate"><code class="notranslate">+----------+     https     +----------+     https     +----------+
|          ----------------&gt;          ----------------&gt;          |
|          |               |          |               |  Actual  |
|  Client  |               |   Relay  |               |  server  |
|          |               |          |               |          |
|          &lt;----------------          &lt;----------------          |
+----------+     https     +----------+     https     +----------+
</code></pre>
<p>Actually it was going quite well. I use Traefik in the frontend to route all related requests to the backend. And in the backend there is a nginx instance to do a just <code class="notranslate">proxy_pass</code> job.</p>
<p>One thing I'd like to mention is how nginx is dealing with SSL/TLS certification. Requests it received from the frontend is http w/o TLS. I had to add the marked lines to make it work with actual server side TLS certification:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-nginx"><pre class="notranslate"><span class="pl-c1">server</span> <span class="pl-c1">{</span>
  <span class="pl-c1">listen</span> <span class="pl-c1">8080</span><span class="pl-c1">;</span>
  <span class="pl-c1">server_name</span> localhost<span class="pl-c1">;</span>      # &lt;--
  <span class="pl-c1">location</span> / <span class="pl-c1">{</span>
    <span class="pl-c1">resolver</span> <span class="pl-c1">8.8.8.8</span><span class="pl-c1">;</span>
    <span class="pl-c1">proxy_pass</span> https://actual.<span class="pl-c1">server</span>.com<span class="pl-v">$request_uri</span><span class="pl-c1">;</span>
    <span class="pl-c1">proxy_ssl_server_name</span> on<span class="pl-c1">;</span> # &lt;--
    <span class="pl-c1">proxy_ssl_session_reuse</span> on<span class="pl-c1">;</span>
  <span class="pl-c1">}</span>
<span class="pl-c1">}</span></pre></div>
<p>Let's take a closer look of the topology now:</p>
<pre class="notranslate"><code class="notranslate">                           +----------------------------------------------+

<p>So it works... Does it? Yeah technically it works very well, for doing the relay job. But here's an issue that about half of the time I can't hold a stable network connection between my client and the relay server! MANY THANKS TO THE FIREWALL. So it comes the bad news that the relay server doesn't do any help of a better connection.</p>
<p>But I would not stop here. Quickly I realized the whole traffic between the client and the server was going through my relay server, which meant that I could monitor anything in it, or even manipulate it as I want.</p>
<p>Let's insert a middleware within the relay server!</p>
<h3>2. Insert the middleware</h3>
<p>I'd like to get rid of all the SSL/TLS stuff. So the best place are there: between Traefik and nginx. I put a http proxy in Golang there (first time Golang experience!).</p>
<p>The http proxy instance is a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/http-proxy-logger">wtsi-hgi/http-proxy-logger</a>, with which I can dump the traffic I care to try to understand the packet structure. Now the topology looks like this:</p>
<pre class="notranslate"><code class="notranslate">                           +-------------------------------------------------------------+
                           |                         Relay server                        |
                           |                                                             |
+----------+     https     |  +---------+   http   +-------------+   http   +---------+  |     https     +----------+

|          |               |  |         |          |             |          |         |  |               |          |
|          &lt;-------------------         &lt;----------|-----(#)-----|-----------         &lt;-------------------          |
+----------+     https     |  +---------+   http   +-------------+   http   +---------+  |     https     +----------+
                           |                                                             |
                           +-------------------------------------------------------------+

                                                         (#) - dump requests/responses
</code></pre>
<p>Everything is under my control. Can I do some funny things to the traffic?</p>
<h3>3. Trick the client</h3>
<p>Thanks to other excellent open-source private server implements, I can find out what messages are sent back to the client by directly reading their source code. It caught my attention that a very bit indicates the user is a supporter, which unlocks some more options on the client side (, and client side only!).</p>
<p>It took me a bit longer time to exactly understand how the bytes are transferred in the response body and extract them in Golang <a href="https://github.com/purple4pur/goup">(code)</a>. And finally I was very surprised that the whole flow worked! Here's the topology now:</p>
<pre class="notranslate"><code class="notranslate">                           +-------------------------------------------------------------+
                           |                         Relay server                        |
                           |                                                             |
+----------+     https     |  +---------+   http   +-------------+   http   +---------+  |     https     +----------+

|  Client  |               |  | Traefik |          |  Http Proxy |          |  nginx  |  |               |  server  |
|          |               |  |         |          |             |          |         |  |               |          |
|          &lt;-------------------         &lt;----------|-----(*)-----|-----------         &lt;-------------------          |
+----------+     https     |  +---------+   http   +-------------+   http   +---------+  |     https     +----------+
                           |                                                             |
                           +-------------------------------------------------------------+

                                                         (*) - trick here!
</code></pre>
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>Well, when I found that special bit, I was asking more options that the client could give me. But the reality is it only gives me about 50% of my expectation. It's not a actual issue because I was giving a best guess of it.</p>
<p>So I'm planing some further steps from here, including bringing back a monitor-only mode, finding more interesting bytes in the traffic, and one more step: can I do some server side jobs? Now I'm so curious if it's possible to implement the friend ranking in the relay side.</p>
<p>Will see later (if any)!</p></div>
